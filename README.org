This project aims to solve Closest Vector in a Lattice problem by using
Spherical Decoding, introduced by Mohammadkarimi et al. (2019).

We are interested in implementing such solution to be able to solve
quantum complexity problems described by Nielsen et al. (2006).

For a detailed explanation of this project, check [[file:cvp_nn.ipynb]].
